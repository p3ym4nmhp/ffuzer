# ffuzzer
A powerful python script for fuzzing admin panel and subdomain quick and safe, on this script we consider method of bypass firewall detection.

We attached a file with name of (admin_panel_lists) with over 7000 ðŸª™ admin panel lists and filename (subdomain_lists) with over 800 well known subdomain lists for our purpose that can be used as a wordlist in your fuzzing process.

This script works very well with both version of python2 and python3 without any problem

We use multithreading method for increase speed of fuzzing process

Every success links in your fuzzing process will be logged in a seprate filename "output" that will generate during a execution of script
