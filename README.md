A powerful python script for fuzzing admin panel and subdomain quick and safe, on this script we consider method of bypass firewall detection.

We use multithreading method for increase speed of fuzzing process

Every success links in your fuzzing process will be logged in a seprate filename "output" that will generate during a execution of script
